# Nowcasting-GDP-using-a-nonlinear-mixed-frequency-factor-approach
This code executes an optimisation program to nowcasting GDP using factors obtained using kernel PCA. The hyperparameters of the Machine Learning model are tuned based on the last two comparable quarters for which GDP figures are unknown within the vintage data at a specific month in the quarter.
